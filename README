Crypt/Imail version 0.01
========================

Encrypt and Decrypt Imail passwords

THE SCOOP

search for "imail decrypt" on google and you 
will find serveral articles dating back around
1999 that discuss the insecurities of Imail's
encryption scheme.  To date they have done
nothing about it.

This is a perl module that uses the information
from those articles to provide functions that
allow you to decrypt and encrypt Imail passwords.

NOTE

I never reversed engineered Imail at any time and 
simply wrote the specs for this program based on
code found at insecure.com's archieved message
board.  In fact I never run Imail, never recommended
Imail to friends or loved ones and have no intention
of providing Imail to any of my clients or collaegues.
